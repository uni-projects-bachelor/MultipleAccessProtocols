# Multiple Access Protocols

This project simulates network multiple access protocols, which allow multiple users to send data simultaneously while minimizing the probability of collisions. The following protocols are implemented:

- **Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA)**
- **Dynamic Time Division Multiple Access (D-TDMA)**
- **Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA)**

For further details, check out the project document (`Doc - MA.pdf`).
